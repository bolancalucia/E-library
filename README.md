Project for college subject Human computer interaction (HCI).
Low and high fidelity screenshots are in the .pptx and .docx files.

While creating and designing the site we used 10 heuristics from the book by Jakob Nielsen 'Heuristic evalution of user interfaces':
>* 1.Match between system and the real world 
>* 2.Consistency and standards 
>* 3.Visibility of system status
>* 4.User control and freedom  
>* 5.Error prevention 
>* 6.Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
>* 7.Recognition rather than recall 
>* 8.Flexibility and efficiency of use 
>* 9.Aesthetic and minimalist design
>* 10.Help and documentation

For visual design, we have the following 4 principles: 
 >* Contrast
 >* Repetition
 >* Alignment
 >* Proximity
